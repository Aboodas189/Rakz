# Rakz (ركز)

"Rakz" aims to enhance concentration and productivity, particularly in virtual learning environments, by monitoring eye movements and calculating a focus score.

**How It Works:**
- Uses a computer camera to track eye movements.
- Detects if the user is looking at the screen, to the side, or has closed eyes.
- Calculates a focus score based on eye position analysis.

**Main Components:**
- Eye and iris feature detection.
- Eye closure duration detection.
- Focus score calculation.
- Focus score For using phone.

**Streamlit:**

Used for creating an interactive web app interface, allowing users to perform real-time focus detection through webcam feeds or upload videos for analysis.


**OpenCV:**

- Provides tools for processing video frames and performing tasks like face and eye detection, which are crucial for tracking gaze direction and blinks.

  
**NumPy:**

- Used for efficient numerical operations, such as manipulating eye landmarks and calculating distances between key facial points.

  
**MediaPipe:**

- Utilized for detecting facial landmarks, including the eyes and irises, enabling accurate tracking of gaze direction and eye closures.
