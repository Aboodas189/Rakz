# Rakz (ركز)

"Rakz" aims to enhance concentration and productivity, particularly in virtual learning environments, by monitoring eye movements and calculating a focus score.

- Detects if the user is looking at the screen, to the side, or has closed eyes.
- Calculates a focus score based on eye position analysis.

**Main Components:**

- Eye closure duration detection.
- Focus score calculation.
