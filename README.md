# Rakz (ركز)

"Rakz" aims to enhance concentration and productivity, particularly in virtual learning environments, by monitoring eye movements and calculating a focus score.

##How It Works:
Uses a computer camera to track eye movements.
Detects if the user is looking at the screen, to the side, or has closed eyes.
Calculates a focus score based on eye position analysis.
Main Components:
Eye and iris feature detection.
Eye closure duration detection.
Focus score calculation.



Here’s a structured style using a similar format for describing a project on GitHub in words:

Project Name
Project Name aims to [briefly describe the purpose of your project, e.g., improve user engagement, increase productivity, etc.] by [explain what the project does, e.g., analyzing data, automating processes, etc.].

How It Works:
[Explain the first main function, e.g., Uses a computer camera to detect movement.]
[Describe the second function, e.g., Identifies different states, such as whether a person is present or absent.]
[Detail the third aspect, e.g., Calculates a specific score based on activity or inactivity.]
Main Components:
[Component 1]: [Explain what this component does, e.g., Data capture and preprocessing.]
[Component 2]: [Explain the function of this part, e.g., Feature extraction and analysis.]
[Component 3]: [Provide details on this part, e.g., Scoring or results generation.]
